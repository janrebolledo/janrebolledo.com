      <article>
        <p>
          I take your privacy seriously and want to be transparent about the
          information I collect and how it's used. This privacy policy explains
          what information I collect, how I use it, and your options for
          managing your information.

        <h2 class="title">Information I Collect</h2>
        <p>
          When you visit JanRebolledo.com, I automatically collect certain
          information about your visit, such as the pages you view, the referral

          understand how visitors interact with my content.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I use session cookies to store a unique identifier for
          your browsing session. This helps me keep track of your progress as
          you navigate my website and enables certain features, such as saving
          your preferences between visits. I do not use cookies to track your
          activity outside of my website.

        <h2 class="title">Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          Under GDPR, I process your personal data only where I have a legal
          basis for doing so. The legal basis for processing your data is your
          consent, which is obtained through your use of my website.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">How I Use Your Information</h2>

        <h2 class="title">Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          I will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill
          the purposes for which it was collected, unless a longer retention
          period is required by law.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          I take the security of your personal data seriously and use
          appropriate measures to protect it from unauthorized access,
          disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of
          transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100%
          secure. Therefore, while I strive to use commercially acceptable means
          to protect your personal data, I cannot guarantee its absolute
          security.
        </p>

        <p>
          I may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes
          in my practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory
          reasons. If I make material changes to this policy, I will provide you
          with notice in accordance with legal requirements.
        </p>
